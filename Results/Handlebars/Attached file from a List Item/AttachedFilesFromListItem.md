# Layouts for attached files belonging to a List Item #

see the blog post at [https://www.m365thinking.com/post/displaying-attached-files-belonging-to-a-list-item-in-search](https://www.m365thinking.com/post/displaying-attached-files-belonging-to-a-list-item-in-search)

The basic idea is to create a layout that will display any attached files from a list item. The layout will display the file name and a link to the file.

The end result will look like this:
![End result](/Results/Handlebars/Attached%20file%20from%20a%20List%20Item/assets/attachedFilesLayout.png)


The layout is available in the assests folder.
